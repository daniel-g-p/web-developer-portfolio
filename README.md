# Web Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my first web developer portfolio, thanks for checking it out! This is my personal showroom for the work I have done so far on my journey as a developer.

## Motivation

Other than being an excellent way to start putting my name out there, this project was largely inspired by my desire to challenge myself to design, develop, and deploy an entire website from start to finish.
