# Web Developer Portfolio

Markup : ![Web Developer Portfolio](./cover_image.png)

Welcome to my first web developer portfolio, thanks for checking it out! This is my personal showroom for the work I have done so far on my journey as a developer.

## Motivation

Other than being an excellent way to start putting my name out there, this project was largely inspired by my desire to challenge myself to design, develop, and deploy an entire website from start to finish. The website was coded following a mobile first approach, which was important to me given the current developments in smartphone usage.

## Technologies

### HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

No surprise here, the front end of this project was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. I purposely avoided using any frameworks such as Bootstrap or Bulma, given that I would like to focus on mastering the fundamentals of web development at this stage in my career.

### Sass

For the first time, I decided to use Sass to preprocess my CSS for this project. Among other things, it helped me familiarize myself with 7-1 folder structure, which may have been a bit of an overkill for such a small project, but it was still a valuable learning experience that will certainly serve me well moving forward, especially when working on a project in cooperation with a team.

### Node JS & Express

For the bit of backend functionality that I implemented in my portfolio, I used Node JS in combination with Express. Although not very complex, this part helped me build a solid knowledge on the exchange of HTTP requests and responses between front and back end.

### Nodemailer

I used the Nodemailer NPM package to build out the contact form on my portfolio. This turned out to be an incredibly useful tool that I will use again in future projects for sure.

### Figma & Illustrator

Before starting to code my portfolio I did some prep work in Illustrator to design my logo and brand and then moved to Figma to create a design template to work off of. Although this added a few days of preparation before I could get to the exciting part of the project, it sure made the coding process much more fluid and easy along the way.

## Features

### Animated Splash Screen

SVG animations were one of the new concepts that I discovered thanks to this project, and you will find a basic implementation of it on the splash screen that appears when the homepage is loaded.

### Scroll Animations

When it comes to JavaScript, animating objects on scroll was another learning outcome of this project, as I included a very subtle fade-in effect on the section blocks of the website.

### Contact Form

After only taking care of the front end of all the contact forms that I had built previously, this was my first time actually making it work. Besides using front end validation, the form informs the user on whether or not their submission was sent successfully on submission.

## Project Status

For now, I plan to leave the portfolio the way it is for a while to focus on other new projects and challenges instead. Moving forward, however, other than updating the "Projects" page regularly, I may implement an interactive form for potential clients to provide information about the project that they would like to work on.
